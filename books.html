            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-4">He wanted her the moment he saw her. She was tied to him in an arranged marriage before she could even understand what it meant. But...

               <br> Aaryan Deshmukh never wanted marriage—until Sriti Dixit. She was elegance, intelligence, and grace, and for a moment, he believed he could have both: her and his duty.
                
                <br>But love? That was never part of the plan.
                
                <br>For Aaryan, duty to the nation always came first. Even if it meant breaking Sriti’s heart—and his own. He walked away, unaware of the truth that bound them still.
                
                <br>Now, fate brings them back together.
                
                Will love find a way, or will duty always come first?
                
               <br> A story of love, sacrifice, and regrets that arrive too late.</p>
